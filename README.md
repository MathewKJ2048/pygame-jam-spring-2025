# pygame-jam-spring-2025

## Design:

### Setup:

- isometric
- synthwave
- wireframe? not necessarily
- rotation allowed but not up/down

### Elements:

- perpetual motion machine
- space warper
- cannon
- enemy
- tower
- battery
- high-tower
- lights

## Explanation:

- space is large and flat initially
- space needs to be explored using lights
- perpetual motion machine produces energy, same at all scales
- space expander - expands space by subdividing it into 5*5, takes energy, explodes if destroyed
- bugs - chase down energy concentrations and attack
- cannons - shoots bugs
- towers - spreads enerygy
- high towers - three connections, but wide range
- player character - flies over the field and constructs underneath itself, immortal

## Lore:

- perpetual motion machine steals energy from alternate dimension
- space expanders weaken fabric of reality, if they explode the sector is lost
- bugs come from the other dimension looking for energy
- ultimate goal - make a energy feeder have a high rate, beams energy straight up, zoom out to reveal the whole thing is a perpetual motion machine?

## Design:

- space expanders - pyramids with something atop them
- lights - small towers which burn something on top
- high towers - like towers but bigger
- batteries - 5*5 cube that fills up with energy, lines same as energy
- perpetual motion machine - 
- cannon - standard design - truncated pyramid base with curling 45* that then points parallel to ground
